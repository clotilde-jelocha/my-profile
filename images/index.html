                    <p>During my youth I had the chance to travel a lot thanks to my parents. I have visited more than 15 countries.</p>
                    <p>Several European countries such as Italy, Austria, Germany, Spain, Greece, Croatia, Malta. Asian countries: Russia, Mongolia, China and South Korea. Also the United States, Morocco, England, Israel and Palestine.</p>

                    <p>In August 2022, my brother and I created our own company called Alphaccess. It concerns restaurateurs.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, Alphaccess aims to build connected systems and websites for restaurants so that they can display their menu or have a reservation system of their own.</p>
                    <p>Within the company I therefore occupy the symbolic post of marketing director and co-founder of Alphaccess.</p>

                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <p>I have several qualities.</p>
                    <p>I am first and foremost an open-minded person who is sociable and curious on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>Then I have an ease to put myself in the shoes of the other people I work with and adapt each <br /> situation according to the character of each. Thanks to this communication, everyone can <br /> bring their contribution to the work of groups for example.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I have a perfectionist side that pushes me to give the best of myself and always finish <br /> what I started. It's important for me to be proud of what I've accomplished no matter how <br /> important the work is.</p>
